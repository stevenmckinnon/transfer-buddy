You can transfer hand sanitiser into a pouch via the <i>Transfer Buddy®</i> and have it conveniently with you. The possibilities are endless. <br />\n                        The <i>Transfer Buddy®</i> is designed and made from materials that are safe and reusable. The pouches are robust and collapse so they can be stuffed into picnic hampers (stop things rattling!), rucksacks, cycle bags, panniers, hand luggage on flights (<b>50ml</b> and <b>100ml</b> volume options), once again the possibilities are endless. You can even freeze the pouches with your favourite soups, sauces, gourmet secret recipes, so versatile, easy to use and saves you money. Great if you have a young family as you can mix their favourite drinks, purees and kids can drink directly from the pouches, saving time, money and mess. <br />\n                        Be kind to yourself, your family and friends, use the <i>Transfer Buddy®</i> and take a little luxury with you wherever you go.\n                    </p>\n                    <Image src={String(Example)} fluid />\n                    <h2>Help us develop Transfer Buddy®!</h2>\n                    <p>Help us by taking a few of minutes to complete our survey</p>\n                    <Button variant=\"primary\" href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/J2HGM5S\">Take Suvery</Button>\n                </Col>\n            </Row>\n            <Row id=\"footer\">\n                <Col xs={12}>\n                    <p className=\"company-name\">Transfer Buddy®, 2020</p>\n                    <div className=\"images\">\n                        <Image src={String(Dolphin)} />\n                        <Image src={String(Eco)} />\n                    </div>\n                </Col>\n            </Row>\n        </Container>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default App;","import * as React from 'react';\nimport { render } from 'react-dom';\nimport App from './components/App';\n\ndocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {\n    render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));\n});"],"sourceRoot":""}
